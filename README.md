# LineFollowingRobot
 My personal project on a robot that can follow a line.

Originally written in Scratch, converted into Arduino C and then further modified. This code is designed to run on the [Makeblock mBot](https://www.makeblock.com/mbot-3) which features an ATmega 328 Board (similar to what is commonly found on the Arduino Uno)/
